            <h1>About Me:</h1>
            
            <p>
                Currently enrolled in the last semester of a computer science bachelor’s degree at ISCTE and looking for an entry into the Job Market.</br></br>

                I like learning new technologies and have always been very eclectic as such, my interests are varied and that is the main reason why I chose an education in the technological field. In my eyes it is the most diverse and presents the most opportunities for creativity, ranging from web applications, automation and game development trough to Hardware Solutions and R&D and finally to CGI, Machine Learning and Quantum Computing.</br></br>

                Trough the course of the degree I gained experience with many types of programming such as object-oriented, functional, imperative, event oriented, logical and concurrent. Furthermore, I acquired knowledge about Algorithms and Data Structures in the realm of Search Algorithms (Binary Search, Depth First, Length First and A*), Sort Algorithms (Merge, Quick and Shell, among others), Trees (Binary, Red-Black, and suchlike), Lists (Including 
                Linked Lists), Queues (Priority, Blocking), Stacks and Dictionaries.Additionally I have gathered some knowledge of Graphs, concepts such as Fuzzy and Predicate Logic and some fundamentals of machine learning (Neural Networks, Decision Trees and so on).</br></br>

                I have worked with Java, Python, C, Prolog, Scala among other Back-end Programming Languages.</br></br>

                In addition, I have some academic and some self-taught experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.</br></br>

                Finally, I have experience with other concepts and tools such as MySQL, MongoDB (NoSQL), Networks (OSI Model), UML, Maven, Trello, Agile (SCRUM), Kanban, Waterfall, Project Management, MS Project, MS Excel.

                                Created several functions to make the game possible using functional programming philosophy including Move, Roll Dice and Answer Feud, among others.

They can also filter the posts by date and sort them by "up/ downvotes", most recent and "up/downvote" ratio.

                        Something else I have always enjoyed doing is cooking and experimenting with new dishes which is ironic since I can be a fussy eater.

                        This is probably my second most favorite hobby right after music, I love watching different tv shows, my favorite tv show is Suits.

                        I also enjoy aquiring General knowlodge and learning interesting factoids as an example did you know that Russian cursive is basically doodling ? Look it up its hillarious.

                        This isn't so much a hobbie as it is who I am, I love making jokes of every kind in any situation, I find that jokes can extract something good especially at the worst of times.
